{-| Create a Shikensu Program.

This is basically a wrapper around `list` and `perform`.
It creates a `SimpleProgram` for you, initialises the needed permissions,
lists the given directory (ie. the focus), and finally performs the given task (sequence).
It also prints errors to stderr or a success message to stdout.

The example below with the comments should help you understand the flow:

    import Shikensu
    import Shikensu.Contrib as Shikensu
    import Shikensu.Focus exposing (Focus(..))
    import Task

    -- Our `Program` which references out `sequence` (more on that later)
    -- and our `Focus`, the target directory we want to list.
    main =
        Shikensu.program sequence CurrentDirectory

    -- This is our `sequence`.
    -- Here we receive a `Task` that contains the directory listing (aka. the compendium)
    -- We essentially do two things with this listing:
    -- (1) We manipulate it (these are the `Task.map` calls)
    -- (2) Or we perform some IO operation (these are the `Task.andThen` calls)
           -> `read` reads the content of the files.
           -> `write` writes the manipulated in-memory representations of the files back to disk.
    sequence task =
        task
            |> Task.map (Shikensu.withExtension "md")
            |> Task.andThen Shikensu.read
            |> Task.map (Shikensu.renderContent markdownRenderer) -- See `example` folder
            |> Task.andThen (Shikensu.write destinationFocus)

-}
program : (Task -> Task) -> Focus -> Program
program sequence focus =
    programs
        [ { focus = focus
          , sequence = sequence
          }
        ]


{-| Provides a way to make multiple lists and operate on them.

Technically not multiple programs, but same idea as
the `program` function, just with multiple lists.

    import Shikensu
    import Shikensu.Focus exposing (Focus(..))

    Shikensu.programs
        [ { focus = Relative (Path.directory [ "posts" ])
          , sequence = Task.andThen Shikensu.read
          }
        , { focus = Relative (Path.directory [ "images" ])
          , sequence = Task.map (\bundle -> ...)
          }
        ]

-}
programs :
    Array
        { focus : Focus
        , sequence : Task -> Task
        }
    -> Program
programs collection =
    perform
        { onSuccess = \env _ -> Stream.sendLine env.stdout "🧪 Sequence completed"
        , onError = \env err -> Stream.sendLine env.stderr ("🚨 " ++ Error.toString err)
        }
        (\fsPermission ->
            collection
                |> Array.map
                        (\{ focus, sequence } ->
                            focus
                                |> list fsPermission
                                |> sequence
                        )
                |> Task.sequence
        )


{-| The `list` function itself, unwrapped.

Recursively lists a directory and then gives you a `Task`
containing a `Bundle` which in turns has an array of `Definition`s
stored under the property named `compendium`.

This collection of `Definition`s is the main thing you'll be working with.
The goal of this library is to scan a file tree, manipulate it and then
optionally write it back to disk. This is done through these definitions.

    import Shikensu
    import Shikensu.Focus exposing (Focus(..))

    Shikensu.perform
        -- To ignore, return `Cmd.none`
        { onSuccess = \env _ -> Stream.sendLine env.stdout "🧪 Sequence completed"
        , onError = \env err -> Stream.sendLine env.stderr ("🚨 " ++ Error.toString err)
        }
        (\fsPermission ->
            CurrentDirectory
                |> Shikensu.list fsPermission
                |> Task.map (Shikensu.withExtension "md")
        )

⚠️ The given `Focus` will always be in the context of
the environment of the resulting Gren binary that is being executed.
So for example, say your `pwd` command returns `~/code/shikensu/`,
and your focus is `Relative (Path.Directory [ "..", "example" ])`.
If you run `./binary/app` the resulting path will be `~/code/example/`.

                                )
                )


{-| A utility function that helps you create programs.

This function is also useful for when you want to write definitions to disk.
Maybe you have a JSON file and you want to split it up in multiple files,
that's something you can do with this function.

    import Shikensu
    import Shikensu.Focus exposing (Focus(..))

    Shikensu.perform
        -- To ignore, return `Cmd.none`
        { onSuccess = \env _ -> Stream.sendLine env.stdout "🧪 Sequence completed"
        , onError = \env err -> Stream.sendLine env.stderr ("🚨 " ++ Error.toString err)
        }
        (\fsPermission ->
            [ { baseName = "json-file-1"
              , content = Just jsonBytes
              , directoryPath = Path.directory [ "splitted" ]
              , extensionName = Just "json"
              , metadata = Dict.empty
              }
            ]
                |> Shikensu.bundle fsPermission
                |> Task.andThen (Shikensu.write CurrentDirectory)
        )

This uses `Node.defineSimpleProgram` and `FileSystem.initialize` underneath
and then manages the `Shikensu.Task` value created by `list` or some other function.

See the `list` function above for an example using `list`.

perform :
    { onSuccess : Node.Environment -> a -> Cmd {}
    , onError : Node.Environment -> Error -> Cmd {}
    }
